# Assignment 2

In this task we have the options of choosing a regression- or classification algorithm. A classification algorithm works the best when you want to classify values into categories, such as the price of a stock categorised as "high price" or "low price". In our current task we are asked to predict the actual value of a Norwegian Airlines stock based on an input-date. In other words, we are supposed to find a fixed value. Based on this a regression algorithm is the best solution for our use case. We decided to use a linear regression algorithm because we have learned to work with this in the labs, even though we know this is not the optimal regression algorithm for our use case.
